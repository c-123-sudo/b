*a)* UDP

*b)* Depends on your host; found in Ethernet header (e.g., MAC address)

*c)* Different values in *Message Type* field (Discover = 1, Request = 3)

*d)*

* First four messages (Discover/Offer/Request/ACK): Same Transaction ID
* Second set: New Transaction ID
* *Purpose*: Helps client match responses to requests

*e)*

* *Discover*: Source IP = 0.0.0.0, Destination IP = 255.255.255.255
* *Offer*: Source IP = DHCP server IP, Destination IP = 255.255.255.255
* *Request*: Source IP = 0.0.0.0, Destination IP = 255.255.255.255
* *ACK*: Source IP = DHCP server IP, Destination IP = 255.255.255.255

*f)* 192.168.4.65

*g)* 192.168.4.65 (contained in DHCP Offer message)

*h)* No relay agent; value = 0.0.0.0

*i)*

* Purpose: Duration for which an IP is leased to a client
* Lease Time: Example IP - 172.1.6.1 (actual time not specified)

*j)*

* Purpose: Releases IP back to DHCP server
* Server does *not* send ACK
* If lost, client continues until lease expires

*k)*

* *Router line*: Default gateway
* *Subnet mask*: Defines subnet boundaries

*l)*Lease time refers to the duration for which a network devices as assigned a specific IF address by a DHCP server.

IP Address -172.1.6.1

* Yes, ARP packets were sent
* Purpose: To resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses
8. No, there is no relay agent in discover and request0.0.0.0
  For  ack and offer has relay agent with ip address 172.1.6.102

9. Ip address lease time : 730005. 8 days 8 hours 
 Purpose yo limit length of time that a client can use an ip address
10. No it does not provide any ack of release message
7.. 172.1.6.102 Request message contains the offered dhcp address
3. In request message it dHcP server identifier 172.1.2.10 dJ p message type request, but in Dhc p discover it has only Dhc p message type discover.
H.A value of 0:0:0:0 indicate there is no relay agent
